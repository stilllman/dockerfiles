# To do
- [ ] Add filters in telegraf to drop useless measures
- [ ] Fix mopidy auth configuration (avoid pasting the credentials multiple times when restarting a container)
- [ ] Add some web clients to mopidy (better suited for spotify)
- [ ] Create continuous queries and retention policies for cleaning InfluxDB (version them)
- [ ] Backup and version Grafana dashboards (put them directly in the containers?)
- [ ] Version cloud-config (ssh keys, mount points, users)
- [ ] Clarify user management (create groups, explicit users in docker, etc.)
